**ToDo Application**
This README file provides an overview of the ToDo application, explaining its functionality and the purpose of each function in the project.

**Project Overview**
The ToDo application is a simple web-based task management system built using Django, a Python web framework. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. The application has the following main features:

Create Tasks: Users can add new tasks with a title and description.
View Tasks: Users can view a list of all tasks added to the system.
Update Tasks: Users can edit existing tasks.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.

**File Structure**
The project consists of the following files and directories:

models.py: Contains the definition of the database models used in the application. In this case, it defines a Todo model representing a task with fields for title, description, and completion status.

forms.py: Defines Django forms used for user input validation and handling in the application. Specifically, it contains a form for creating and updating tasks (TodoForm).

views.py: Contains the view functions responsible for handling HTTP requests and rendering templates. This is where the application logic resides.

templates/: Directory containing HTML templates used to render the user interface. It includes templates for displaying tasks (index.html), updating tasks (second.html), and confirming task deletion (delete.html).

**Explanation of Functions**
hello(request):

This function serves as the main entry point for the application.
It retrieves all tasks from the database (Todo.objects.all()).
Initializes an empty form for creating new tasks (TodoForm()).
Handles form submission for creating new tasks. If the form is valid, it saves the new task to the database and redirects the user to the main page.
Renders the index.html template with the list of tasks and the form for adding new tasks.

updatetodo(request, pk):
This function is responsible for updating existing tasks.
It retrieves the task with the given primary key (pk) from the database.
Initializes a form pre-filled with the task's current data (TodoForm(instance=var1)).
Handles form submission for updating tasks. If the form is valid, it saves the updated task to the database and redirects the user to the main page.
Renders the second.html template with the form for updating the task.

delettodo(request, pk):
This function deletes a task from the database.
It retrieves the task with the given primary key (pk) from the database.
Deletes the task from the database.
Redirects the user to the main page.

deletconfirmation(request, pk):
This function renders a confirmation page before deleting a task.
It retrieves the task with the given primary key (pk) from the database.
Renders the delete.html template with the task details for confirmation.

**To run the ToDo application locally, follow these steps:**

Clone the project repository.
Install Django and any other dependencies specified in the project.
Set up the database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) as configured in settings.py.
Run the Django development server.
Access the application in a web browser.

**Technology Used**
The ToDo application utilizes the following technologies:
Django: Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides built-in features for authentication, database migrations, URL routing, and more, making it suitable for developing web applications efficiently.

SQLite3 (or other Database): SQLite3 is a lightweight relational database management system used for storing task data in the ToDo application. However, the application can also be configured to use other databases supported by Django, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle.

HTML/CSS: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for creating the structure of web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout. Templates in the ToDo application are written in HTML and styled using CSS to provide a visually appealing user interface.

Bootstrap (optional): Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework used for building responsive and mobile-first websites. While not explicitly mentioned in the project files, Bootstrap or similar CSS frameworks may be used to enhance the styling and responsiveness of the ToDo application's user interface.

These technologies work together to create a functional and user-friendly ToDo application. Additionally, Django's extensive documentation and community support make it easy to develop and maintain web applications with robust features.
